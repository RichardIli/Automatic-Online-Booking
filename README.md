## üí° How It Works

1.  **User Visits Page:** The user opens the `index.html` in their browser.

2.  **Fetch Services:** The JavaScript code makes an API call to your Vercel-deployed Express.js backend to retrieve a list of available services.

3.  **Display Services:** The fetched services are dynamically rendered on the webpage.

4.  **User Books:** The user fills out the booking form and submits it.

5.  **Send Booking Request:** The frontend sends the booking data to a specific API endpoint on your backend.

6.  **Backend Processes & Confirms:** Your Express.js backend receives the request, processes the booking, and then triggers the automatic email confirmation to the user.
